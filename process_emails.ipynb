      "Forwarded email: Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors \"in smoke filled rooms\", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n",
      "\n",
      "Price caps are almost never the right answer\n",
      "Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\n",
      "Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer\n",
      "Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\n",
      "Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray\n",

      "SCE\u0001,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete \n",
      "cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a \n",
      "program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations \n",
      "and other measures. \n",
      "Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE\u0001,s \n",
      "available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8 \n",
      "million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash \n",
      "conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\n",
      "II. Credit Relationships\n",
      "Highlights:\n",
      "SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to \n",
      "extend or renew credit as it has become due.\n",
      "At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\n",
      "SCE\u0001,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. \n",
      "Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and \n",
      "payable.\n",
      "SCE\u0001,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond \n",
      "indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more \n",
      "indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\n",

      "III. Energy Cost Scenarios\n",

      "This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess \n",
      "various price scenarios upon SCE\u0001,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such \n",
      "scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\n",
      "IV. Cost Containment Initiatives\n",
      "Highlights\n",
      "SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\n",
      "The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital \n",
      "improvement component as follows (in millions):\n",

      "As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE\u0001,s \n",
      "Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\n",
      "Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the \n",

      "D.01-01-018.\n",
      "Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from \n",
      "generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are \n",

      "TURN Proposal\n",
      "As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN \n",
      "to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. \n",
      "Our comments are summarized as follows:\n",
      "The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it \n",
      "would not directly generate nor use cash.\n",
      "The Proposal\u0001,s impact on SCE\u0001,s balance sheet would initially be to shift \n",
      "costs between two regulatory assets.\n",
      "TURN\u0001,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the \n",

      "VI. Flow of Funds Analysis\n",
      "Highlights:\n",
      "In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a \n",
      "positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\n",
      "During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to \n",
      "its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\n",
      "Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its \n",
      "shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common \n",
      "stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative \n",
      "and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n",
      "[there is no Section VII]\n",
      " \n",
      "VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\n",
      "SCE\u0001,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500 \n",
      "million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. \n",
      "In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million. \n",
      "This increase correlates to the increase in market prices\n",
      "for natural gas for the same period.\n",

      "Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \n",
      "proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \n",
      "based on the governor's comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \n",
      "we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \n",
      "communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \n",
      "go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \n",
      "the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \n",
      "work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \n",
      "talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \n",
      "level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \n",
      "benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \n",
      "would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n",
      "(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \n",
      "solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \n",
      "the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\n",
      "Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \n",
      "included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \n",
      "interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \n",
      "goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \n",
      "to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \n",
      "analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \n",
      "including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \n",
      "He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \n",
      "purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \n",
      "some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\n",
      "His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \n",
      "under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \n",
      "Some of these ideas would require legislative action.\n",
      "State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \n",
      "generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \n",
      "they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \n",
      "was a frequently recurring theme.\n",
      "Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \n",
      "basis to consumers.\n",
      "Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \n",
      "California.\n",
      "State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \n",
      "widely deploy distributed generation.\n",
      "Expand in-state gas production.\n",
      "Take state lands gas royalties in kind.\n",
      "negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \n",
      "addtional gas supplies.\n",
      "Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \n",
      "maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \n",
      "any one time.\n",
      "Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\n",
      "Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \n",
      "more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \n",
      "able to help out here).\n",
      "Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \n",
      "some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \n",
      "some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \n",
      "thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \n",
      "approach with generators.\n",
      "Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.\n",
      "To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's \n",
      "thoughts and get them to Kari)\n",
      "He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \n",
      "not just the 5 one year strips.\n",
      "He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\n",
      "He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \n",
      "deal.\n",

      "proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \n",
      "based on the governor's comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \n",
      "we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \n",
      "communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \n",
      "go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \n",
      "the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \n",
      "work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \n",
      "talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \n",
      "level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \n",
      "benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \n",
      "would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n",
      "(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \n",
      "solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \n",
      "the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\n",
      "Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \n",
      "included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \n",
      "interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \n",
      "goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \n",
      "to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \n",
      "analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \n",
      "including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \n",
      "He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \n",
      "purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \n",
      "some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\n",
      "His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \n",
      "under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \n",
      "Some of these ideas would require legislative action.\n",
      "State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \n",
      "generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \n",
      "they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \n",
      "was a frequently recurring theme.\n",
      "Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \n",
      "basis to consumers.\n",
      "Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \n",
      "California.\n",

      "widely deploy distributed generation.\n",
      "Expand in-state gas production.\n",
      "Take state lands gas royalties in kind.\n",
      "negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \n",
      "addtional gas supplies.\n",
      "Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \n",
      "maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \n",
      "any one time.\n",
      "Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\n",

      "more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \n",
      "able to help out here).\n",
      "Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \n",
      "some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \n",
      "some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \n",
      "thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \n",
      "approach with generators.\n",

      "Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support\n",
      "Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n",

      "According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n",

      "Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\n",
      "The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis.\n",

      "SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\n",
      "At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\n",
