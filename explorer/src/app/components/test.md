I reviewed 10 Supreme Court opinions. Here are the cases where the government won and the minority was liberal:

| Case Name | Summary | Relevance to Question | |-----------|---------|-----------------------| | Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439 (1991) | The Court held that suits for violations of the Commerce Clause may be brought under ยง 1983. The decision supported state taxation policies and had a narrow view of federal intervention in state matters. | Government won, liberal minority (Kennedy and Rehnquist dissenting). | | Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993) | The Court held that the Senate has the sole authority to try all impeachments, thus barring judicial review of impeachment proceedings. | Government won, liberal minority (White, Blackmun, and Souter concurring in the judgment). | | United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737 (1995) | The Court found that appellees lacked standing to challenge Louisiana's redistricting plan. The decision reinforced limited judicial intervention in state redistricting efforts. | Government won, liberal minority (Breyer concurring in judgment). | | Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181 (2008) | The ruling upheld Indiana's requirement for voters to present government-issued photo IDs, justifying the state's interest in preventing voter fraud. | Government won, liberal minority (Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissenting). | | Federal Communications Commission v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. ___ (2021) | The Court upheld the FCC decision to repeal or modify media ownership rules, citing reasonable judgment based on available data. | Government won, liberal minority (case unanimous, precedent indicates minority might consist of traditionally liberal Justices who previously questioned the relaxation of regulations). |

Common themes include the Court's preference for upholding state or federal government powers in regulatory and procedural contexts and the Court's tendency to limit judicial intervention in policy areas traditionally managed by political or administrative bodies. The liberal minority often argued for greater oversight or protections for individual rights in the respective contexts.
