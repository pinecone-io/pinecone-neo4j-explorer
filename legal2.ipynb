Two of the jurors had brothers who had\\nbeen convicted of crimes, and petitioner no longer presses his\\nobjection to exclusion of those individuals. The ethnicity of one\\nof the other two jurors was uncertain. Without waiting for a ruling\\non whether Hernandez had established a prima facie case of\\ndiscrimination under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S.\\n79, the prosecutor volunteered that he had struck these\\ntwo jurors, who were both bilingual, because he was uncertain that\\nthey would be able to listen and follow the interpreter. He\\nexplained that they had looked away from him and hesitated before\\nresponding to his inquiry whether they would accept the translator\\nas the final arbiter of the witnesses\\' responses; that he did not\\nknow which jurors were Latinos; and that he had no motive to\\nexclude Latinos from the jury, since the complainants and all of\\nhis civilian witnesses were Latinos. The court rejected Hernandez\\'s\\nclaim, and its decision was affirmed by the state appellate\\ncourts.\\n\\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\\n\\n75 N.Y.2d 350, 553 N.Y.S.2d 85, 552 N.E.2d 621, affirmed.\\n\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and\\nJUSTICE SOUTER, announced the judgment of the Court, concluding\\nthat the prosecutor did not use peremptory challenges in a manner\\nviolating the Equal Protection Clause. Under Batson\\'s\\nthree-step process for evaluating an objection to peremptory\\nchallenges, (1) a defendant must make a prima facie\\nshowing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on\\nthe basis of race, (2) the burden then shifts to the prosecutor to\\narticulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in\\nquestion, and (3) the trial court must determine whether the\\ndefendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful\\ndiscrimination. Pp. 500 U. S.\\n358-372.\\n\\n(a) Since the prosecutor offered an explanation for the\\nperemptory challenges and the trial court ruled on the ultimate\\nquestion of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue\\nwhether Hernandez made a prima facie showing of\\ndiscrimination is moot. Cf. United States Postal Service Bd. of\\nGovs. v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711,\\n460 U. S. 715.\\nP. 500 U. S.\\n359.\\n\\nPage 500 U. S. 353\\n\\n(b) The prosecutor offered a race-neutral basis for his\\nperemptory strikes. The issue here is the facial validity of the\\nprosecutor\\'s explanation, which must be based on something other\\nthan race. While the prosecutor\\'s criterion for exclusion --\\nwhether jurors might have difficulty in accepting the translator\\'s\\nrendition of Spanish-language testimony -- might have resulted in\\nthe disproportionate removal of prospective Latino jurors, it is\\nproof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose that is required\\nto show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See\\nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,\\n429 U. S. 252,\\n429 U. S.\\n264-265. This Court need not address Hernandez\\'s\\nargument that Spanish-speaking ability bears such a close relation\\nto ethnicity that exercising a peremptory challenge on the former\\nground violates equal protection, since the prosecutor explained\\nthat the jurors\\' specific responses and demeanor, and not their\\nlanguage proficiency alone, caused him to doubt their ability to\\ndefer to the official translation. That a high percentage of\\nbilingual jurors might hesitate before answering questions like\\nthose asked here and, thus, would be excluded under the\\nprosecutor\\'s criterion would not cause the criterion to fail the\\nrace neutrality test. The reason offered by the prosecutor need not\\nrise to the level of a challenge for cause, but the fact that it\\ncorresponds to a valid for-cause challenge will demonstrate its\\nrace-neutral character. Pp. 500 U. S.\\n359-363.\\n\\n(c) The trial court did not commit clear error in determining\\nthat the prosecutor did not discriminate on the basis of the Latino\\njurors\\' ethnicity. A trial court should give appropriate weight to\\nthe disparate impact of the prosecutor\\'s criterion in determining\\nwhether the prosecutor acted with a forbidden intent, even though\\nthat factor is not conclusive in the preliminary race neutrality\\ninquiry. Here, the court chose to believe the prosecutor\\'s\\nexplanation and reject Hernandez\\'s assertion that the reasons were\\npretextual. That decision on the ultimate question of\\ndiscriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort\\naccorded great deference on appeal, regardless of whether it is a\\nstate court decision and whether it relates to a constitutional\\nissue. See, e.g., 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.\\nS. 335, 479 U. S. 351.\\nDeference makes particular sense in this context because the\\nfinding will largely turn on an evaluation of credibility.\\nHernandez\\'s argument that there should be \"independent\" appellate\\nreview of a state trial court\\'s denial of a Batson claim\\nis rejected. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,\\nInc., 466 U. S. 485;\\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104;\\nNorris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587,\\ndistinguished. Here, the court took a permissible view of the\\nevidence in crediting the prosecutor\\'s explanation. Apart from the\\nprosecutor\\'s demeanor, the court could have relied on the facts\\nthat he defended his use of peremptory challenges without being\\nasked to do so by\\n\\nPage 500 U. S. 354\\n\\nthe judge, that he did not know which jurors were Latinos, and\\nthat ethnicity of the victims and the prosecution witnesses tended\\nto undercut any motive to exclude Latinos from the jury. Moreover,\\nthe court could rely on the facts that only three of the challenged\\njurors can with confidence be identified as Latinos, and that the\\nprosecutor had a verifiable and legitimate explanation for two of\\nthose challenges. Pp. 500 U. S.\\n363-370.\\n\\n(d) This decision does not imply that exclusion of bilinguals\\nfrom jury service is wise, or even constitutional in all cases. It\\nmay be, for certain ethnic groups and in some communities, that\\nproficiency in a particular language, like skin color, should be\\ntreated as a surrogate for race under an equal protection analysis.\\nCf., e.g., Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, 271 U.\\nS. 500. And, a policy of striking all who speak a given\\nlanguage, without regard to the trial\\'s particular circumstances or\\nthe jurors\\' individual responses, may be found by the trial judge\\nto be a pretext for racial discrimination.

If, as in this\\ncase, the trial court believes the prosecutor\\'s nonracial\\njustification, and that finding is not clearly erroneous, that is\\nthe end of the inquiry. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S.\\n79, does not require that a prosecutor justify a jury\\nstrike at the level of a for-cause challenge or that the\\njustification be unrelated to race.

Dugger\\n\\nNo. 89-5961\\n\\nArgued Nov. 7, 1990\\n\\nDecided Jan. 22, 1991\\n\\n498 U.S. 308\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\nA Florida jury convicted petitioner Parker of first-degree\\nmurder for the killings of Richard Padgett and Nancy Sheppard. At\\nthe advisory sentencing hearing, the jury found that sufficient\\naggravating circumstances existed to justify a death sentence as to\\nboth murders, but that sufficient mitigating circumstances existed\\nto outweigh those aggravating factors, and therefore recommended\\nthat Parker be sentenced to life imprisonment on both counts. The\\ntrial judge, who has ultimate sentencing authority under state law,\\naccepted the jury\\'s recommendation for the Padgett murder, but\\noverrode the recommendation for the Sheppard murder and sentenced\\nParker to death. The judge explained, inter alia, that he\\nhad found, based on a review of the evidence, six statutory\\naggravating circumstances as to the Sheppard murder, and no\\nstatutory mitigating circumstances. He did not discuss evidence of,\\nor reach any explicit conclusions concerning, nonstatutory\\nmitigating evidence, but declared that \"[t]here are no mitigating\\ncircumstances that outweigh the aggravating circumstances in\"\\neither count. Although concluding that there was insufficient\\nevidence of two of the aggravating circumstances relied on by the\\ntrial judge, the State Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence,\\ndeclaring that the trial court had found no mitigating\\ncircumstances to balance against the four properly applied\\naggravating factors. The court ruled that the facts suggesting the\\ndeath sentence were \"so clear and convincing that no reasonable\\nperson could differ,\" and therefore that judicial override of the\\njury\\'s recommendation of life was appropriate under state law. The\\nFederal District Court granted Parker\\'s habeas corpus petition as\\nto the imposition of the death penalty, ruling that the sentence\\nwas unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals reversed.\\n\\nHeld: The Florida Supreme Court acted arbitrarily and\\ncapriciously by failing to treat adequately Parker\\'s nonstatutory\\nmitigating evidence. Pp. 498 U. S.\\n313-323.\\n\\n(a) Although the trial judge\\'s order imposing the death sentence\\ndoes not state explicitly what effect he gave Parker\\'s nonstatutory\\nmitigating evidence, it must be concluded that the judge found and\\nweighed such evidence before imposing the sentence. The record\\ncontains substantial\\n\\nPage 498 U. S. 309\\n\\nevidence, much of it uncontroverted, favoring mitigation.\\nMoreover, the judge declined to override the jury\\'s recommendation\\nof life imprisonment for the Padgett murder, indicating that he\\nfound nonstatutory mitigating circumstances in that murder.\\nFurthermore, the judge stated that he found no mitigating\\ncircumstances \"that outweigh\" aggravating circumstances, indicating\\nthat nonstatutory mitigating circumstances did, in fact, exist. Pp.\\n498 U. S.\\n313-318.\\n\\n(b) Thus, the State Supreme Court erred in concluding that the\\ntrial judge found no mitigating circumstances to balance against\\nthe aggravating factors, and consequently erred in its review of\\nParker\\'s sentence. Where a reviewing court in a weighing State\\nstrikes one or more of the aggravating factors on which the\\nsentencer relies, the reviewing court may, consistent with the\\nConstitution, reweigh the remaining evidence or conduct a harmless\\nerror analysis. Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.\\nS. 738, 494 U. S. 741.\\nThe State Supreme Court did not conduct an independent reweighing\\nof the evidence, since it explicitly relied on what it took to be\\nthe trial judge\\'s findings of no mitigating circumstances.\\nMoreover, even if the court conducted a harmless error analysis,\\nthat analysis was flawed by the court\\'s ignoring of the evidence of\\nmitigating circumstances in the record. Although a federal court on\\nhabeas review must give deference to a state appellate court\\'s\\nresolution of an ambiguity in a state trial court\\'s statement,\\nWainwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78,\\n464 U. S. 83-85,\\nit need not do so where, as here, the appellate court\\'s conclusion\\nis not fairly supported by the record in the case. Pp. 498 U. S.\\n318-320.\\n\\n(c) The State Supreme Court\\'s affirmance of Parker\\'s death\\nsentence based upon nonexistent findings was invalid because it\\ndeprived Parker of the individualized treatment to which he is\\nentitled under the Constitution.
